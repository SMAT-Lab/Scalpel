# Welcome to Scalpel's documentation!

Scalpel is a Python module integrating classical program anaysis algorithms
with tailored features for Python language. It aims to provide simple and
efficient solutions to software engineering researchers that are accessible to
everybody and reusable in various contexts.


# Setting up Scalpel

You can download the source code of Scalpel to install mannualy or use `pip` to install automatically.
The framework has not been uploaded to PyPI repository yet since it's still in beta.

```python
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/SMAT-Lab/Scalpel.git
```
