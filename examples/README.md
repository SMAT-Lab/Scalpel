# Scalpel Tutorials

Scalpel is a framework for static analysis of Python code. It provides a variety of functionalities, such as static single assignment (SSA), call graph construction, and control flow graph (CFG) analysis.

This repository contains example tutorials that demonstrate how to use Scalpel to perform these functionalities. The tutorials are written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and are accompanied by required background information and code snippets. 

The tutorials are organized as follows:

* [Static Single Assignment (SSA)](SSA_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Call Graph Construction](call_graph_tutorial.ipynb.md)
* [Control Flow Graph (CFG)](CFG_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Import Graph Construction](import_graph_tutorial.ipynb)
* [API Name Qualification](API_name_qualifying_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Code Rewriter](Rewriter_tutorial.ipynb)
* [Type Inference](type_infer_tutorial.ipynb)


To get started, simply click on the link for the tutorial that you are interested in. The tutorial will explain the functionality in detail and provide code snippets that you can use to experiment with Scalpel.

We hope that you find these tutorials helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
